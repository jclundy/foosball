Progress
- added logic to switch b/t speed and position mode for arduino's stepper driver
- added logic to center the carriage after running the startup routine

Next steps
- implement 'open loop' controller using hand controller or mouse/keyboard inputs

Dec 29 2021
Todo
- implement logic to reset linear motor steps (need to edit arduino logic too)
- implement logic to go to position (need to edit arduino logic too)

- once the above is done, work on logic for 'open loop' control mode using hand controller or mouse/keyboard inputs

Progress
- relearned how to implement & build a ros node
- implemented node to run a startup routine driving the carriage forward and backwards

Next steps

1. Startup routine

Arduino side:
- arduino should startup in STANDBY_MODE
- should listen for CALIBRATION_MODE command
-- listen to speed command
-- listen for 'set steps'
void AccelStepper::setCurrentPosition 	( 	long  	position	) 	

ROS side
- implement ros node in c
- refresh on how to setup c project and compile
-- maybe see if this is easy to do in python?
- listen for linear position
- send set speed command
- send set steps command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

2. Ball tracking
- do test with live ball tracking
- look into way to measure latency
- test other tracking methods - get file to compile
- implement ros node in c

3. Manually control speed with low latency
- implement ros node in c
- mouse and keyboard inputs?  

4. ball motion tracking
- implement ball state estimation node
- 
- make linear motor follow ball position

5. use aruco markers for board limits
