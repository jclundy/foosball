Next steps

1. Startup routine

Arduino side:
- arduino should startup in STANDBY_MODE
- should listen for CALIBRATION_MODE command
-- listen to speed command
-- listen for 'set steps'
void AccelStepper::setCurrentPosition 	( 	long  	position	) 	

ROS side
- implement ros node in c
- refresh on how to setup c project and compile
-- maybe see if this is easy to do in python?
- listen for linear position
- send set speed command
- send set steps command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

2. Ball tracking
- do test with live ball tracking
- look into way to measure latency
- test other tracking methods - get file to compile
- implement ros node in c

3. Manually control speed with low latency
- implement ros node in c
- mouse and keyboard inputs?  

4. ball motion tracking
- implement ball state estimation node
- 
- make linear motor follow ball position

5. use aruco markers for board limits
